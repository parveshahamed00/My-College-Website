                                like. People think it's this veneer-that the
                                designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think
                                design is. It's not just what it
                                looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</p>

                                interacting with the product.Managing the user experience involves an 8-step design
                                process. It needs to understand user behavior and
